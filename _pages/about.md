Hi there! ðŸ––

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Engineering Department](https://bmb.cu.edu.tr/) at [Cukurova University](https://www.cu.edu.tr/), affiliated with the [Cukurova Applied AI Research Group](https://avesis.cu.edu.tr/researchteamsite/cukurovaai). 

Previously, my research has focused on control theory, particularly in the field of nonlinear control. My current research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and robot control. I am actively exploring the integration of these disciplines to develop advanced control systems for autonomous robots.

I received my doctoral and masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Engineering from Cukurova University and obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from Kocaeli University.

The best way to contact me is by email: [bata@cu.edu.tr](mailto:bata@cu.edu.tr)
